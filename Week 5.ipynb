Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after tag soup). It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping\n",
    "1.New York Population : Insights from the data :\n",
    " Manhattan (New York County) is the geographically smallest and most densely populated borough.\n",
    " Manhattan's (New York County's) population density of 72,033 people per square mile (27,812/km2) in 2015 makes it the highest of any county in the United States and higher than the density of any individual American city.\n",
    "Brooklyn (Kings County), on the western tip of Long Island, is the city's most populous borough.\n",

    "This analysis is performed on limited data. This may be right or may be wrong. But if good amount of data is available there is scope to come up with better results. If there are lot of restaurants probably there is lot of demand. Brooklyn and Manhattan has high concentration of restaurant business. Very competitive market. Bronx, Queens and Staten Island also has good number of restaurants but not as many as required. So this can be explored.\n",
    "As per the neighbourhood or restaurant type mentioned like Indian Restaurant analysis can be checked. A venue with lowest risk and competition can be identified."
